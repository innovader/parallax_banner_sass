<p>
  Formerly known as Burma, Myanmar is considered as the Golden Land. Its culture is heavily influenced by Theravada Buddhism, combined with several local elements. The Shwedagon Pagoda in particular is the most important pagoda as it reveals early British occupation in Burma during the first Anglo-Burmese War.
